## Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I am gxost!

I am software developer that likes _poking around_ with C++ and Python, tho sometimes touch other languages too. I love doing some low level stuff, especially **network related**. I can do mobile development too. Looking forward to have at least one full stack cross-platform app!
